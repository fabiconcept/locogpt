# Loco GPT

Loco GPT is an AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. It is designed and implemented as part of a final year project titled "Design & Implementation of an AI Assistant." This project aims to develop a chatbot using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Build Tools

The following tools were used in the development of Loco GPT:

- **Reactjs**: Reactjs is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a powerful framework for creating interactive web applications with a component-based architecture.

- **OpenAI API**: Loco GPT leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to generate natural language responses. The API enables the AI assistant to understand and respond to user queries intelligently.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is a comprehensive development platform that provides a wide range of backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and hosting. Loco GPT utilizes Firebase for user authentication and storing data.

- **Vercel**: Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy web applications quickly and easily. It provides a seamless integration with Reactjs and allows for efficient hosting and deployment of Loco GPT.
